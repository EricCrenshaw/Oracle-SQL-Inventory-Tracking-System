# PL-SQL

I created this inventory tracking system as my final project in an Introductory SQL course.

The system consists of 7 programs:
	1) Setup.sql: Creates the six tables needed to update or query inventory data as an employee
	2) createPO.sql: Allows employees to place an order for new inventory from listed suppliers
	3) receivePO.sql: Allows employees to update listed inventory based on received shipments.
	4) QueryPO.sql:
	5) Aging.sql:
	6) ShortShip.sql:
	7) SupplierMonthly.sql:
