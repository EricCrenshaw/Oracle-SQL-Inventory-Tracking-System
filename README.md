# SQL Project One

I created this inventory tracking system as my final project in an Introductory SQL course.

The system consists of 7 programs: <br> <OL>
<li>	Setup.sql: Creates the six tables needed to update or query inventory data as an employee  <br>
<li>	CreatePO.sql: Allows users to place an order for new inventory from listed suppliers <br>
<li>	ReceivePO.sql: Allows users to update listed inventory based on received shipments <br>
<li>	QueryPO.sql: Allows users to access information for placed orders <br>
<li>	Aging.sql: Populates an aging report given a user-specifed time-frame as input <br>
<li>	ShortShip.sql: Populates all completed orders where units received is less than units ordered <br>
<li>	SupplierMonthly.sql: Populates a comprehensive summary report of all Supplier-based transactions by month <br></OL>

Together these programs serve as a basic inventory tracking system, allowing front-end users to order new inventory, update inventory, and pull data from past transactions.
